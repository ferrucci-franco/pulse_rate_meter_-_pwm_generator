# Pulse-rate meter and PWM generator with Modbus interface
This projet presents a custom-designed instrument that has two main features:
* measurement of the pulse-rate of a number of digital input signals, 
* generation of pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals. 

The instrument was implemented in a STM32F4 DISCOVERY board.

Regarding the first functionality, the device computes the pulse-rate of a number of digital inputs and 
transmits the information through a communication channel to a master device. More specifically, the 
device counts the number of rising edges of twelve digital inputs simultaneously. The counting process 
takes place during a series of consecutive one-second time frames. At the end of each time frame, the 
device updates the registers with the last pulse-counts. Since the time window duration is one second, 
the values of the registers are equal to the frequency of each input (in Hz). The master device (e.g. a 
computer) accesses the deviceâ€™s registers through a polling process using Modbus-RTU protocol. 

As for the second functionality, the device generates two independent PWM signals, whose parameters 
(i.e. frequency and duty cycle) are set by the master device.
